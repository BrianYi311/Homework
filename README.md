# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This was our first opportunity to edit a website using HTML and CSS. It was good practice to use HTML semantics and chaining similar CSS codes. I learned how a structred HTML and CSS file should look like and how to keep it clean and concise. 

## Installation

## Usage

Just an example first website to be compared to the original.
